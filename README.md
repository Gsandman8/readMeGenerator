## Description
A project to use inquirer and NodeJS to create a CLI application to generate polished readMe files. This application provides a series of questions once the application is invoked and their answers are entered into an automatically generated markdown file.

## Installation
This application can be installed by cloning the github repo and using "npm i inquirer@8.2.4" in order to download the node modules necessary for this application to run.

## Usage
This application can be used to create any markdown file that requieres a format of a typical readme file. Simply answer any questions for sections that you need and the resulting markdown file will have all sections and corresponding table of contents links that have content.
